        <p>I don't know what type of individual I would be today without the presence of one of my best companions, the Internet. From my very first flash game to the last viral video I opened, the Internet has provided me with countless forms of entertainment and joy. Its profound impact is one of the main reasons why I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>

        <p>Additionally, it has constantly opened doors and opportunties that I never would have heard about until they appeared right in front of me. Had the Internet played a less substantial role in my adolescence, I definitely would've missed out on some of my most exciting and adventureous milestones. That is why I chose to become an aspiring computer programmer. Gifted minds have utilized their toolset so that everyday people like myself can create social experiences from the click of a button. I want to follow in their footsteps and continue making life easier for my community with a simple click.</p>

        <p>If you take a chance on me, I will deliver results to the best of my ability.</p>
