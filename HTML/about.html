				<p>I don't know where I would be today nor what goals I would be striving for without the presence of one of my oldest companions, the Internet. Its huge impact in my life is one of the main reasons why I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>

				<p>The Internet has constantly opened doors and opportunties I've never heard about until they appeared right in front of me. If I had never touched a computer in my life, I definitely would've missed out on some of my most exciting and adventureous milestones. That is why I am an aspiring computer programmer. Other people have utilized their toolset so that everyday people can create social experiences from the click of a button. I want to do the same for my community.</p>

				<p>Lastly, as a kid who grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I've witnessed most of the exciting (and not-so-exciting) transformations that flow from the current cultural and technological revolution. Needless to say, I am so ready to take on the world as a young programmer who is seeking to learn new skills and constantly improve.</p>

				<p>If you take a chance on me, I promise to deliver.</p>
